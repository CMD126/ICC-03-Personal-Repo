# Basic Python Script

This script is a simple demonstration of how to use Python to execute shell commands and capture their output.

## Functionality

The script performs the following actions:

1.  Executes the `ls` command and saves the output to a file named `list.txt`.
2.  Executes the `whoami` command and saves the output to a file named `user.txt`.
3.  Reads the contents of `list.txt` and `user.txt` and prints them to the console.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python3 script.py
```
