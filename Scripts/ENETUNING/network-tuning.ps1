# Enables TCP Receive Window Auto-Tuning to 'normal'.
# This allows the OS to adjust the receive buffer size dynamically, which is crucial for high-speed networks.
Write-Host " - Enabling TCP Receive Window Auto-Tuning..."
netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal

# Enables TCP Chimney Offload.
# This offloads TCP/IP processing from the CPU to the network adapter, freeing up CPU resources.
Write-Host " - Enabling TCP Chimney Offload..."
netsh int tcp set global chimney=enabled

# Enables Receive Side Scaling (RSS).
# RSS distributes the processing of network traffic across multiple CPU cores, preventing bottlenecks.
Write-Host " - Enabling Receive Side Scaling (RSS)..."
netsh int tcp set global rss=enabled

# Enables NetDMA (Direct Memory Access).
# This allows the network adapter to transfer data directly to memory without CPU involvement.
Write-Host " - Enabling NetDMA..."
netsh int tcp set global netdma=enabled

# Enables ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification).
# ECN helps manage network congestion more efficiently without dropping packets, improving throughput.
Write-Host " - Enabling ECN Capability..."
netsh int tcp set global ecncapability=enabled

# Disables TCP Heuristics.
# This prevents Windows from automatically modifying TCP settings in response to certain network conditions,
# which can sometimes lead to performance degradation.
Write-Host " - Disabling TCP Heuristics..."

# Sets the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) to 1500 for the detected adapter.
# 1500 is the standard MTU for Ethernet and ensures compatibility and optimal packet size.
